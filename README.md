# Robo-Soccer-Bot
Built a wireless RC Car with damage protection body.

#throwback-april-2024

This bot was built for an event called " Robo Soccer " during the tech fest ELECTRA ( There's a repository before this) . The objective was to push the ball using these bots and reach the goal post area.

I scoured the internet for reference and they were all wired bots. again with the #Everything_i_want_to_be_different mentality I decided to make it wireless.

This has absolutely no documentation, this are the only proofs I have.

I made it with the help of my buddy @akhilsamvarghese He designed the 3D Files and printed it for me. I was busy with the whole tech fest, so also helped me assemble the rc bot also.

<b>Construction</b>

3D files are designed and printed by @akhilsamvarghese I only had to screw the motors, nrf module, arduino nano. The bot is powered by 2 Li-ion Cells ( internal connection pictures are not found in the gallery ).

The remote was made with a joystick module to operate the bot and it was powered by a 9V battery.


<b>Coding</b>
-------------

Codes were already available in the internet, so i saved my time there.


Here's the video of the bot in action ðŸ‘‡
